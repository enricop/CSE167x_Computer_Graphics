About CSE167x

CSE167x is an introduction to Computer Graphics. Students will understand the concepts of 3D graphics, and develop programs that create images of a 3D scene with lighting, using both real-time OpenGL and GLSL programming, as well as offline raytracing. The focus is on foundations and writing your own programs, rather than learning use of a specific software like Maya or Photoshop.
